        <h1>Welcome to the Animal Welfare Society Port Elizabeth</h1> 

        <p>The Animal Welfare Society (AWS) of Port Elizabeth is a safe shelter for animals that have been lost, neglected and abandoned.</p>
        <p> All of the animals that we house, are up for adoption to the public.</p>
        <p>Not only do we look after our animals, but we also run a service whereby we will respond to any reports of animal cruelty.</p>
        <p>We have a very helpful team of 40 that make up our staff. We have different sections to our staff, such as those who look after the animals, veterinarians and those who respond to cases of abuse.</p>

        <p>In the video above, you will evidently see that we offer help to community, voluntarily. At the AWS we are happy to offer a helping hand, when needed.</p>
