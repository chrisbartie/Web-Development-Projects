        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>The Animal Welfare Society of Port Elizabeth is a non-profitable organization that strives for animal safety and good community work.
            We accept any form of donation or volunteer related work. We make sure that each animal brought in, finds a safe new home and family.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Animal Welfare Society (AWS) of Port Elizabeth was founded in 1971, when a group of private animal safety homes
            were opened as a result of more and more animals becoming abandoned and an increase in animal cruelty in South Africa. 
            Since the opening of AWS PE, many improvements have been made and many animals lives have been saved and made better by finding safer homes.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>At The Animal Welfare Society, we strive for to be against animal cruelty and neglect.
            We offer safe and comfortable living conditions for animals in need.
            We also focus on our customers as we try to offer them a stress free, respectful and simple service, as and when we deal with them.
            The community is also one of our growing focuses as we take it as our responsibility to educate them about animal cruelty and how they should look out for it and try to put an end to it.</p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>We plan to educate the public on anti animal cruelty to the point where the amount of animals brought in is decreased.
            By 2030 we hope to open another branch in Port Elizabeth, to ease the overcrowding of animals at certain times of the year.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The AWS has goals set for 2022 such as:</p>

        <p> Hold educational classes on animal cruelty every month<br>
        Reduce the number of animals brought in by 50%<br>
        Find animals a new home much faster, using better marketing strategies<br>
